   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache**
   - The new modular structure requires fresh files

3. **Check console**
   - Verify all modules load correctly
   - Should see "Quantum Trail initialized successfully!"

4. **Test features**
   - All game modes should work
   - Real-time stats should update
   - Achievements, shop, etc. should function

### 📝 Notes
